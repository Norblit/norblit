### Welcome, my name is Norbey!

You can view my live web portfolio here: https://www.norblit.com/

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: An anime list database where every registered user can create and edit their own list of anime shows or movies. I am using AniList's API for data entry, login authentication/authorization, form data validation, CRUD Functionality, and much more (this project will be published on GitHub after beta stage completion). Afterwards I will return to implementing and refining features on another project, [AutoScroll](https://github.com/Norblit/AutoScroll)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Advanced JS, React.js, MongoDB, Algorithms and Data Structures
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on beginner to intermediate web applications/projects preferrably on a MERN stack for a deeper practice and I am as well seeking for an internship or full-time employment as a Junior Web Developer
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anime, chess, or coding!
